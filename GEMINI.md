# Project Overview

This directory contains the source files for the book "Agentic Design Patterns" by Antonio Gulli, along with a Portuguese translation and supplementary materials. The project's main goal is to provide a comprehensive guide to agentic AI design patterns, including theoretical explanations, practical code examples, and audio summaries.

## Directory Structure

*   `original/`: Contains the original English version of the book in Markdown format. Each file corresponds to a chapter or section.
*   `pt-br/`: Contains the Portuguese translation of the book, mirroring the structure of the `original/` directory. The translation is of high quality and uses appropriate technical terms.
*   `assets/`: Contains images and other assets used in the book.
*   `codes/`: Contains Python code examples that illustrate the concepts discussed in the book. These examples use libraries like `langchain`, `crewai`, and `google-adk`.
*   `podcasts/`: Contains audio summaries of the book chapters in MP3 format.

## Key Files

*   `original/07-chapter-1-prompt-chaining.md`: The first chapter of the book, which introduces the concept of prompt chaining.
*   `pt-br/07-capitulo-1-prompt-chaining.md`: The Portuguese translation of the first chapter.
*   `codes/chapter-1-prompt-chaining.py`: A Python script that demonstrates prompt chaining using the `langchain` library.
*   `readme.md`: Provides a brief overview of the project and links to the original author's work.

## Usage

This directory can be used as a resource for learning about agentic AI design patterns. Readers can explore the book's content in either English or Portuguese, run the code examples to see the concepts in action, and listen to the podcast episodes for a quick summary of the chapters.

To run the code examples, you will need to have Python and the required libraries (`langchain`, `crewai`, `google-adk`, etc.) installed. You will also need to set up the necessary API keys for the language models used in the examples (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini).
