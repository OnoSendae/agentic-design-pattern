The Agentic AI Advantage: Hype, Reality, and What Comes Next thoughtworks

`AGENTIC AI IS A TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE THAT WILL DRIVE STEP-CHANGE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION ACROSS INDUSTRIES.`

Gene Reznik, Chief Strategy Officer, Thoughtworks ust two years ago, the term `AI agent` barely registered outside research labs. Today, AI agents are one of the most hyped topics in tech-and it`s not hard to understand why. The pitch is a powerful one: AI agents can take care of time-consuming tasks so you don`t have to. They can plan, make decisions, and use tools to take actions and achieve goals on your behalf. Proponents suggest they might do anything from organizing your business meetings to maintaining your software systems. In time, some claim, AI agents will take on tasks of extraordinary length and complexity. `I think that people will ask an agent to do something for them that would have taken them a month,` said OpenAI`s CEO Sam Altman late last year. `And they`ll finish in an hour.` J

Global investment in AI agent-related startups has also duly exploded, with more than $2.8 billion flowing into the space in the first half of 2025 alone. Ninety three percent of IT leaders say they plan to implement AI agents before the end of 2026, and mentions of `agentic AI`-a term typically used to describe an AI system comprising agents-have soared by 275 percent in company earnings calls. To `AI maximalists,` AI agents don`t merely represent an incremental advance in what software can do, but a generational leap-one that stands to do much more than simply improve personal and corporate productivity. The bull case is that agentic AI will reimagine how organizations operate, rewire how economies function, and open up new possibilities for how we live and work.

`Agentic AI is a transformative technological advance that will drive step-change productivity improvement and innovation across industries,` says Gene Reznik, Chief Strategy Officer at Thoughtworks. `It will allow enterprises and governments to reimagine their business processes and commercial models, unlocking new sources of competitive advantage and differentiation.`

For business leaders, however, there is a challenge: F or all the promise, there is a counter-narrative to contend with. Skeptics say the reality doesn`t match the hype. A key criticism is that agents are unreliable. Since they are built on language models (LMs), which have a meaningful error rate, they can make mistakes, fabricate information, get stuck in feedback loops, and diverge from intent. Combined with their limited memory, agents struggle particularly in tasks that have multiple steps. In one now notorious instance, an AI coding agent deleted a software company`s live production database. Detractors also point to security vulnerabilities that let hackers hijack agents to steal data, manipulate systems, and spread malware. Gartner believes over 40 percent of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, `due to escalating costs, unclear business value, or inadequate risk controls.`

So what is going on here-are agents the future of enterprise, or is it all just hot air? The truth is not so binary. Enterprises are already deriving value from AI agents, but these are not the general-purpose, autonomous `digital co-workers` that the industry rhetoric sometimes implies. Successful deployments tend to involve more constrained systems, human supervision, and specific, contained use cases: A practical approach that aims to mitigate current limitations. Realizing the broader transformational promise will require overcoming a number of technical hurdles.

Business leaders should seriously explore agents as they stand today, taking a clear-eyed view of what they are and where they can offer value across the enterprise. At the same time, they should track developments and be prepared to act fast if the field makes further advances and the dream of autonomous super-assistants starts to materialize.

## The reality of agents today



So where are we now with agents: What can they do, how are they being deployed, and where are there proven examples of their effectiveness?

To unpick that, we first need to clear up some nuances around language.

People use the term agent to mean a wide variety of different things. At one end of the spectrum, some businesses have rebranded traditional software like RPA as agents. At the other end, evangelists conjure visions of all-knowing, do-anything systems. Both can confuse matters. The former is just `agent washing` to attract investment and PR, and the latter is an ambition for the future rather than a reflection of what`s possible now.

In practice, businesses today are indeed using agents that represent a genuinely new class of software: AI that doesn`t just answer questions but can use tools and take actions to achieve a predetermined goal. It`s just that aside from some highly specialized systems, these agents tend to be task-specific, operate within tight bounds and almost always have a human in the loop. Look at what most companies mean when they say they`re running an agent, and typically it more accurately resembles an LM-based workflow.

That`s less grandiose than the rhetoric-but that can nonetheless be powerful. For his book Agentic Artificial Intelligence (Irreplaceable Publishing, 2025), the automation expert Pascal Bornet and his co-authors gathered data from 167 companies in a wide range of sectors that have deployed agents. These organizations report that they are seeing measurable value across a multitude of business functions as a result. In customer service applications, for examplethis encompasses online chatbots as well as tools for human operators to do their job more effectively-resolution times can improve by as much as 30 percent.

Organizations that successfully implement AI agents right now tend to identify use cases that balance ambition with pragmatism. The most effective use cases involve narrowly defined, repetitive activities where the results fall within known parameters, errors are either obvious or not critical, and risk exposure is minimal. Those building successful agents put serious work into the scaffolding around them,

`  EVERY FUNCTION HAS WORKFLOWS OF SOME KIND, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE POTENTIAL USE CASES FOR AI AGENTS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE C-SUITE.`

Rachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks from context engineering to memory design to governance.

Arguably the most sophisticated and impactful task where agents have tight product-market fit is writing computer code. This is because the output is inherently and immediately verifiable. The program either runs or it doesn`t. So many companies rely on code production-not just software companies, but any business that wishes to build its own internal tools-that this is a shift that is relevant to a wide swathe of the economy. Even intensely physical sectors like manufacturing stand to be affected. Siemens, for instance, is developing a coding agent to rapidly create instructions for industrial machinery such as conveyor belts and CNC machines.

Another common use case is deep, specialized research. This can enable faster human reasoning at scale-currently a major productivity bottleneck-and can help companies outpace competitors. One example is Thoughtworks` collaboration with the global pharmaceutical company, Bayer, on a project called PRINCE (Preclinical Information Center). This involved developing an agent that acts as a research assistant in the complex and painstaking area of preclinical drug development. The agent can very rapidly trawl through huge amounts of data from historical studies, retrieving relevant information efficiently, and accelerating human decision-making.

More complex agentic deployments aim to bring together a number of task-specific agents into an orchestrated system. This is a frontier idea that the PRINCE  project is currently exploring: a multi-agent system for answering complex questions, drafting regulatory documents, designing new studies, and planning experiments.

The promise of agents as they are largely used today is all  about  making  existing  processes  more  efficient.  That might not be the profound transformation that the big AI labs are dreaming of, but for many businesses that is a major priority-especially in organizations where senior people  spend  disproportionate  time  doing  low-level, repetitive tasks for which they are over-qualified.

Rachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer for Thoughtworks, regularly meets with senior enterprise leaders and is seeing

enthusiasm for AI agents across all areas of senior management. `They may not always know exactly what AI agents are or the precise advantage they`ll bring, but they absolutely want them-and rightly so. Every function has workflows of some kind, which means there are potential use cases for AI agents in every corner of the C-suite.`

Businesses should assess whether agents as they are today could create value for their operations, too. If leaders want to get involved, Danilo Sato, Global VP of AI at Thoughtworks, says that there are a number of key dos and don`ts. Here are five:

If AI agents are forced to use inadequate data sources to retrieve the context and information they need to complete a task, this will impact the quality of their outputs.

Identify real problems, and devise measurable solutions. Make this a top-down rather than bottom-up effort, otherwise, you can end up with a landscape of incompatible tools. `It can become like the old shadow IT problem on steroids,` says Sato.

A key principle is to build security and access control at all levels: controlling what internal data the agent can access, and what tools they can invoke. Depending on the use case, it can also be important to avoid allowing the agent to read external data, as bad actors can hide malicious prompts in documentation.

AI makes mistakes, so it`s vital that users learn to resist `automation bias` and instead question, test, and verify outputs to ensure accuracy. Most successful AI agent implementations are designed with a human in the loop.

Sato adds that it`s crucial for enterprises to establish belief in the value of AI and agents among their workforce, which will in turn drive adoption. `With some clients, we`ve seen that they`ve built a solution but people aren`t using it, either because they feel threatened by it, or because they don`t see the full benefits of it,` he says.

## What comes next?

`  WHAT IF WE COULD REIMAGINE A WHOLE PROCESS, A WHOLE VALUE STREAM, A WHOLE FUNCTION OF AN ORGANIZATION, OR HOW A N ORGANIZATION CONNECTS WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION?`

Danilo Sato, Global VP of AI, Thoughtworks

## Tech doesn`t stand still. So how could agents develop from here?

Bornet says the immediate ambition is to build agents that can work together with very limited supervision, although strictly within a defined area of expertise. Equivalent to cars driving themselves, but only under specific conditions.

If that becomes possible, it could allow agentic AI to go beyond discrete low-level tasks and begin to optimize businesses at a more systemic level, not just making existing processes more efficient, but creating new, better capabilities. `What if we could reimagine a whole process, a whole value stream, a whole function of an organization, or how an organization connects with another organization?` asks Sato. This could involve coordinating between different departments to dynamically orchestrate supply chains, perhaps, or manage product development pipelines.

The onus is on organizations to track developments, and be prepared to adapt quickly if crucial breakthroughs are made. And progress is happening. The length of tasks AI agents can complete is doubling roughly every seven months, for instance, while technologists are already devising the plumbing to make this new layer of digital activity possible. Open-source initiatives such as the Model Context Protocol aim to create universal standards for agent-tool interactions; payments companies are creating APIs to let agents make payments. `I think over the next couple of years we`ll start seeing a lot of investment in rebuilding our digital spaces to be agentfirst,` says Erin Kraemer, Senior Principal Technical Product Manager for Agentic AI at AWS. `That will mean that when agents are using external tools, they are less and less reliant on trying to make sense of the visual elements that were designed for the human brain.`

But much work still needs to be done. The most significant barrier to this next phase of agentic development is the question of reliability.

While it`s true that newer and bigger language models are becoming more reliable, there are many tasks where even one percent unreliability renders the agent 100 percent useless.



`  THE QUESTION ISN`T WHETHER AI AGENTS WILL TRANSFORM YOUR INDUSTRY. IT`S WHETHER YOU`LL LEAD THAT TRANSFORMATION OR BE DISRUPTED BY IT.`

Pascal Bornet, automation expert, author of Agentic Artificial Intelligence (Irreplaceable Publishing, 2025)

With  AI  agents,  this  error  rate  compounds  with each call to the model, meaning that long chains of tasks ultimately lead to the process collapsing.

Considerable resources are being invested in the quest to ensure that the agents of the future always do the things they`re supposed to do-and do them reliably. Shayan Mohanty, Chief Data and AI Officer at Thoughtworks, says this is an `existential issue,` not just for agents but for generative AI in general.

There are multiple avenues of research. One involves identifying core evaluation metrics that give the user a clear picture of whether an agent is performing as intended. Another involves agents checking the output of other agents. Some believe that to really overcome current limitations, however, it may require different AI architectures altogether. We may need `world models,` perhaps, that have a structural understanding of reality, or neuro-symbolic AI, which fuses current generative AI with more traditional, logic-based AI.

The scale of the effort to crack these problems makes sense when you imagine the competitive advantages that autonomous  multi -agent  systems  could  bring  to businesses,  particularly  if  the  reasoning  capabilities  of the underlying models continue to advance.

At the most basic level, agents that can be trusted to act without supervision could be applied to critical business functions from which today they are excluded. That means more of the business could be automated. But it seems likely it would not just be about making existing things better-it would be about overhauling operations wholesale. Imagine: agents could continuously monitor market conditions, competitor activity, and internal performance to make real-time strategic adjustments. Research agents could constantly experiment with new product ideas, run virtual tests, analyze patent landscapes, and identify breakthrough opportunities. These agents could interact with other agents in dedicated B2B marketplaces to make purchases and get things done.

This in turn may lead to new operating models and transform  organizational  structures.  Traditional departmental silos would give way to more horizontal

collaboration, says Reznik. `Historically, we`ve all built processes by saying, `Hey, my sales process is in Salesforce, my marketing process is in Adobe, my supply chain process is in SAP,` and all data, workflows, and the organizational constructs aligned accordingly,` he explains. `But agents will increasingly traverse these functional boundaries and their underlying systems of record.` As a result, agents will in a sense act as the connective tissue between corporate functions, flattening the enterprise and making it more agile.

The challenge is that predicting how technology will develop is an inexact science. In a field with as much activity as AI, it`s difficult to forecast where we will be even six months from now. Given this, does it therefore in fact make sense for organizations to perhaps bide their time and wait until the `fog of AI,` as some call it, begins to clear before they even start investing in agents?

No, says Laycock. She believes that regardless of what the future holds there are two compelling reasons for enterprises to get involved right now. `One is the kind of proficiency gains that you`ll get from different use cases by taking humans out of not-very-interesting loops,` she says. `And the other is that you don`t want to get left behind. Sitting and waiting is not a smart move.`

Bornet agrees. `The question isn`t whether AI agents will transform your industry,` he says. `It`s whether you`ll lead that transformation or be disrupted by it.`

## Visions of an agentic future

`  I  THINK IT`S POSSIBLE THAT ULTIMATELY YOU`LL ONLY NEED A COUPLE OF GENERAL PURPOSE AGENTS, AND THAT`S WHAT WILL ENABLE MORE PROFOUND THINGS.`

Shayan Mohanty, Chief Data and AI Officer , Thoughtworks

## Given the pace of change, trying to envisage the further

-out agentic future-perhaps three to five years from nowis practically impossible. If the technology`s capabilities make radical advances, whole new forms of agent-native business are likely to be invented, but trying to predict them today would be like trying to foresee the app economy when the first Nokia and Motorola mobile phones were introduced.

The main question that hovers over any discussion of the long-term agentic future is whether we will ever see fully autonomous, general-purpose agents. Not just domainspecific agents that can work together with limited supervision, but truly `self-driving`, go-anywhere agents. Right now there is a limit to the size of multi-agent systems, and therefore to what they can do. `Agents are essentially software packages, so if you run huge numbers of agents you`re incurring the cost of maintaining all those software packages. At the moment, I don`t see a way for us to do that that isn`t massively labor intensive at a very large scale,` says Mohanty. `I think it`s possible that ultimately you`ll only need a couple of general purpose agents, and that`s what will enable more profound things.`

A system like this may create competitive advantage in paradigm-shifting ways. This could theoretically include perfect market timing; a level of personalization that supercharges loyalty; and the ability to rapidly connect insights across industries, geographies, and time periods, to produce innovations beyond what we can envision today.

If agents like this become possible, they could serve as the `operating system` for whole businesses. One aspect of this that Bornet thinks would be especially important is that this system would have `institutional memory`-the power to recall every decision, project outcome, customer interaction, and market shift across decades, as well as, crucially, every interaction with AI, which by that point will have become embedded in practically every process. `Consider a global pharmaceutical company,` he says. `Their AI agents won`t just assist with drug discovery-they`ll remember every compound tested, every clinical trial result, every regulatory challenge faced, every successful pathway to market, every conversation and action that got them there.`



When researchers propose a new therapeutic approach, the AI would instantly connect patterns, identifying not just what might work, but subtle factors such as what team configurations will deliver the best results.

A new class of businesses altogether may emerge. Perhaps we may have agentic companies-Reznik certainly envisions a time when a `superagent` could play the role of a trusted board member or an executive. Perhaps we may also have companies with physical robot use extending into field operations, alongside humans. `I do think we also need to think about the case of agents truly becoming personified via robotics,` says Mohanty. `That would be really interesting because then you also have to bring psychology into the mix: what does that communication look like with our AI counterparts, and how do we treat them?`

The implications for business leaders would clearly be vast. When faced with such unknown unknowns perhaps there are really only two pieces of advice: preserve your strategic flexibility and maintain acute situational awareness. Tactics might include maintaining optionality in vendor relationships, building modular capabilities so the organization can re-compose itself as necessary, and resisting investment decisions that assume a single future scenario is inevitable.

`I`ve been in tech for more than twenty years, and this is the most potentially disruptive technology I`ve seen,` says Laycock. `And it`s already here and having an impact. It`s letting us accelerate delivery, experiment faster, and get ideas into the hands of customers sooner. For organizations that embrace it, it really is like having superpowers.`
